# Terraform Project Documentation

## Introduction

This repository contains Terraform configuration files for managing infrastructure as code. Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool that provides a consistent CLI workflow to manage hundreds of cloud services. Terraform codifies cloud APIs into declarative configuration files.

## Prerequisites

- Terraform installed on your machine.
- Basic understanding of Terraform syntax and structure.
- Appropriate access rights to the cloud environment you are working with.

## Setup

Before you start using Terraform, ensure you have configured your cloud provider credentials. These credentials are often set as environment variables or defined in Terraform configuration files.

## Basic Terraform Commands

### Terraform Initialization

- `terraform init`

  This command is used to initialize a working directory containing Terraform configuration files. It is the first command that should be run after writing a new Terraform configuration or cloning an existing one from version control. It safely installs and configures Terraform's backend and plugins.

### Terraform Plan and Apply

- `terraform plan`

  The `plan` command creates an execution plan. It determines what actions are necessary to achieve the desired state specified in the configuration files.

- `terraform apply`

  This command is used to apply the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration, or the pre-determined set of actions generated by a `terraform plan` execution plan.

  - `--auto-approve`: Skips interactive approval of plan before applying.

### Terraform Format

- `terraform fmt`

  Automatically updates configurations in the current directory for readability and consistency. It can also be used to ensure that all your configuration files adhere to a consistent style.

  - `-recursive`: Also process files in subdirectories. By default, `fmt` scans only the current directory.

### Terraform Destroy

- `terraform destroy`

  This command is used to destroy the Terraform-managed infrastructure. This command is the opposite of `terraform apply`. It will terminate resources managed by your Terraform project.

## Working with this Repository

- **Initialization**: Run `terraform init` to initialize the project.
- **Applying Changes**: After making changes, run `terraform plan` to see what changes will be applied, and `terraform apply` to apply those changes.
- **Formatting Code**: Use `terraform fmt -recursive` to format the code.
- **Destroying Infrastructure**: Use `terraform destroy` to remove all resources managed by this project.
